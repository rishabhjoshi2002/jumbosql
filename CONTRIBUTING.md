```

### 4. Test your changes

Install [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [venv](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/), and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

Run `make` to see the available commands.

> **Resource requirements**:
> - `make molecule-converge` — creates 3 containers and deploys a PostgreSQL cluster. **Minimum: 4 GB RAM, 2 CPU cores, 10 GB disk** (8 GB RAM recommended).
> - `make tests` — runs all test scenarios and is significantly more resource-intensive. **Minimum: 8 GB RAM, 4 CPU cores, 20 GB disk** (16 GB RAM recommended).
>
> On systems with limited RAM, use `make molecule-converge` for a quick functional test, then `make molecule-destroy` to clean up.

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies: `make bootstrap-dev`
2. Format your changes: `make prettier`
3. Lint your changes: `make lint`
4. Run the tests: `make molecule-converge` (lightweight) or `make tests` (all scenarios)

To test a specific distribution, set `IMAGE_NAMESPACE` and `IMAGE_DISTRO`:

```bash
IMAGE_NAMESPACE=geerlingguy IMAGE_DISTRO=debian13 make molecule-converge
```
